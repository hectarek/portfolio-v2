## 5. My Brand and Personality

Portfolio Voice & Style Guide

For Hector Gonzalez — CTO, Start up Co-Founder, Full stack Engineer, Entrepreneur, Maker, Consultant, and Problem Solver

1. Brand Positioning Statement

A problem-focused technical leader who designs scalable, modern products. Blends engineering clarity with educational vision to turn complex ideas into repeatable, high-impact experiences.

⸻

2. Tone & Voice

Voice Qualities
	•	Direct — information-first, no fluff.
	•	Analytical — grounded in reasoning, structure, and constraints.
	•	Pragmatic — minimal, efficient, purpose-driven.
	•	Builder Mindset — focuses on systems, pipelines, architecture, and execution.
	•	Modern Technical — uses contemporary stacks, patterns, and automation approaches.

Tone Adjustments by Context
	•	Homepage: confident, concise, high-level.
	•	Project Pages: structured, technical, explicit about process and decisions.
	•	Blogs/Thinking: explanatory, systemic, reference-friendly.

⸻

3. Style Rules

A. Sentence Style
	•	Prefer short, declarative sentences.
	•	Avoid filler (“excited,” “passionate,” “synergy,” etc.).
	•	Default to active voice.
	•	Use parallel structure (e.g., “Plan → Build → Ship”).

Example:
“I built a Next.js + Bun microservice that ingests recipes, normalizes data, and syncs it to Notion.”

B. Structural Style
	•	Use bullet points often.
	•	Lead with the outcome, then the method.
	•	Include constraints and design choices explicitly.
	•	Use clear section headers: “Problem,” “Constraints,” “Solution,” “Results.”

C. Technical Style
	•	Name the tools only where relevant (Next.js 14, Bun, Drizzle, Vercel Blob, Railroad microservices).
	•	Show architecture diagrams or schemas (JSON, TypeScript interfaces, system flows).
	•	Emphasize reproducibility and automation.

4. What to Emphasize About Yourself

A. Systems Design

Your strongest and most consistent theme.
Highlight:
	•	Templates
	•	Pipelines
	•	Architecture decisions
	•	Scaling strategies
	•	Repeatable patterns
	•	Data flows
	•	“Reuse → Wrap → Build” design model

B. Engineering + Product Hybrid

You are both CTO and hands-on developer.
Your brand benefits from demonstrating:
	•	How you define requirements
	•	How you translate them into architecture
	•	How you build with minimal complexity

C. Educational Innovation

Make clear that you are building modern learning systems, not generic apps:
	•	Game-based learning
	•	Micro-credential ecosystems
	•	Structured curriculum pipelines
	•	Tools for teachers and administrators
	•	Student operations and scheduling systems

D. Automation + Tooling

You consistently automate:
	•	Allocations systems
	•	Google Sheets Apps Script
	•	Data ingestion
	•	Background worker jobs
	•	AI-integrated flows
	•	JSON schema generation

This is part of your signature style.

6. Visual Style Guidance

This controls how your portfolio should feel visually.

A. Overall Aesthetic
	•	Minimal
	•	Clean grids
	•	Neutral colors (white, black, gray, accents sparingly)
	•	Code snippets + diagrams as core visuals
	•	Small animations/transitions (Framer Motion)
	•	No heavy illustration unless functional (e.g., diagrams)

B. Components That Fit Your Brand
	•	Architecture diagrams
	•	Flowcharts
	•	JSON schemas
	•	Data tables
	•	Mini demos of systems
	•	XP / mastery / pathways visuals
	•	Screenshots of internal tools (Notion, Sheets, etc.)

Your work is inherently technical and system-oriented—your visuals should reflect that.
